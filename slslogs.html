<br>
<span class="SLS">[SLS]:</span> “...Wh–”
<br>
<span class="SLS">[SLS]:</span> <span class="sysnotes">[Subject mimics a sound akin to choking.]</span>
<br>
	<span class="NCTG">[NCTG]:</span> <span class="sysnotes">[They laugh.]</span> “Ah, my apologies... I couldn't help playing up the announcement for dramatic effect. Don’t worry; it’s not <em>really</em> that big of a change.”
<br>
<span class="SLS">[SLS]:</span> “...Oh. M-My bad.” <span class="sysnotes">[Subject smiles.]</span>
<br>
	<span class="NCTG">[NCTG]:</span> “It’s fine! Still, though, you <em>are</em> being promoted. The Project needs your help.”
<br>
	<span class="NCTG">[NCTG]:</span> “Internally, you are now an official ‘Assistant’ to this project, just like Umbra! That's quite a step up from Puppet 	Designer. Now, <em>externally</em>, your new role is, hm...something akin to a <b>mascot</b>, maybe? How fun!”
<br>
<span class="SLS">[SLS]:</span> “I, uh... Ah, um, I...”
<br>
	<span class="NCTG">[NCTG]:</span> “It’s alright; I understand you are too grateful for words. I know you take your responsibilities <em>very</em> seriously.”
<br>
<span class="SLS">[SLS]:</span> “R-Right, I, um...”
<br>
	<span class="NCTG">[NCTG]:</span> “Hm? Is something wrong?”
<br>
<span class="SLS">[SLS]:</span> “Ah, um, n-no, Director! I, uh, just shocked! I am, um, <em>extremely</em> grateful for the promotion! Thank you, Sir! I shall do my best, of course! I...I won't let you down!”
<br>
	<span class="NCTG">[NCTG]:</span> “Ah, wonderful! Thank you, Starlight Symphony. I can always count on <em>you</em> to understand. You are a very quick learner! Voids, I wish <em>every</em> subject could be as intelligent as you.”
<br>
<span class="SLS">[SLS]:</span> “Ah, um, y-you praise me too much, Director...! I am just following instructions!”
<br>
	<span class="NCTG">[NCTG]:</span> “And so humble, too! Truly, you are this project's ‘<b>Little Star</b>!’"
<br>
<span class="SLS">[SLS]:</span> “...Um...I-I don’t need a title like that, Director. Just my name is fine...”
<br>
	<span class="NCTG">[NCTG]:</span> “Nonsense! You've been working so diligently, and your exceptionalism deserves to be recognized! I'm sure everyone will <em?love</em> the nickname.”

<span class="SLS">[SLS]:</span> “...”

<span class="SLS">[SLS]:</span> “...I understand. Thank you.” </p>
