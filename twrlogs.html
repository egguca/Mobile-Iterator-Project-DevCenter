<br>
	<span class="TWR">[RR]:</span> “This Unit was constructed to serve as an 'Assistant' for the Mobile Iterator Project.

	<span class="TWR">[RR]:</span> “Is something wrong?”
<br>
<span class="SLS">[SLS]:</span> “Um... You keep referring to yourself in the third-person. <em> Technically speaking,</em> there isn't anything wrong with that, but...it makes you sound like less of an individual. And... That's a little sad, I think...” 
<br>
	<span class="SLS">[SLS]:</span> “Could you do me a favor, please? Rather than saying 'this Unit', could you try saying 'I' and 'my' instead? Just try it out.” </p>

<br>
<span class="TWR">[RR]:</span> “Why are you apologizing?”
<br>
		  <span class="SLS">[SLS]:</span> “Um… It's a force of habit, I guess? I make a lot of mistakes, so I end up apologizing a lot to make up for it. Um, it's actually <em> because </em> I keep making so many mistakes that you had to be made…”
<br>
<span class="TWR">[RR]:</span> “Do not worry; I shall not fail you. I am designed to succeed in all that is asked of me. I shall be there to supplement you whenever necessary.”

<br>
The Director was absent due to summons from the Global Council, so I was tasked with handling this activation on my own. I did my best to handle things properly, but I was really excited, so I got a little carried away. I’m sorry. Hopefully it isn’t too much of a bother... </p>

Subject has successfully formed a bond with UNIT_09. Review further interactions to determine if a formal introduction to UNIT_02 is necessary.

Active Assistant (MIP_09) projects her personal desires onto Subject several times during the activation procedure. This may potentially prove problematic in the future. Monitor recent and future interactions between Subject and MIP_09 closely. </p>
