<span class="SLS">[SLS]:</span> “That's right! <em> Yay, this is going so well...</em> Um, can you tell me your purpose, please?”
<br>
	<span class="TWR">[RR]:</span> “This Unit was constructed to serve as an 'Assistant' for the Mobile Iterator Project. This role entails duties such as managing other MIP Units and following orders from the Director. Crucially, this Unit was also designed to protect and serve the other designated Assistants.”

<br>
	<span class="TWR">[RR]:</span> “Is something wrong?”
<br>
<span class="SLS">[SLS]:</span> “Um... You keep referring to yourself in the third-person. <em> Technically speaking,</em> there isn't anything wrong with that, but...it makes you sound like less of an individual. And... That's a little sad, I think...” 
<br>
	<span class="SLS">[SLS]:</span> “Could you do me a favor, please? Rather than saying 'this Unit', could you try saying 'I' and 'my' instead? Just try it out.” </p>

<br>
<span class="TWR">[RR]:</span> “Why are you apologizing?”
<br>
		  <span class="SLS">[SLS]:</span> “Um… It's a force of habit, I guess? I make a lot of mistakes, so I end up apologizing a lot to make up for it. Um, it's actually <em> because </em> I keep making so many mistakes that you had to be made…”
<br>
<span class="TWR">[RR]:</span> “Do not worry; I shall not fail you. I am designed to succeed in all that is asked of me. I shall be there to supplement you whenever necessary.”

<br> 
<span class="SLS">[SLS]:</span> “You see, Architects use these to help them see when they're not wearing masks, so it’s not something you get to see very often. It adds a sort of ‘cool’ and ‘edgy’ feeling to your overall appearance, and it makes your face look a little sharper…”

<br>
The Director was absent due to summons from the Global Council, so I was tasked with handling this activation on my own. I did my best to handle things properly, but I was really excited, so I got a little carried away. I’m sorry. Hopefully it isn’t too much of a bother... </p>

Subject has successfully formed a bond with UNIT_09. Review further interactions to determine if a formal introduction to UNIT_02 is necessary.

Active Assistant (MIP_09) projects her personal desires onto Subject several times during the activation procedure. This may potentially prove problematic in the future. Monitor recent and future interactions between Subject and MIP_09 closely. </p>
