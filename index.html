<h1 class="mt-2"> MIP AU Overview </h1>

<p class="blurb-text text-center mt-3 px-3"> What is the "Mobile Iterator Project?"
<br>
<br>
The "Mobile Iterator Project" details a Rain World Alternate Universe focused around the titular Project and its relevant characters. It's primarily focused on Original Characters rather than pre-existing ones, and the lore and themes differ quite drastically from both Vanilla and Downpour. It takes inspiration from other OC-focused fanworks like Daszombes' "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J41WOb_Lsa0&list=PLUl8awHLnNLyb3Spg1QEI2uiOUx98ql_l">Iterator Logs</a>" and my friends' worldbuilding. ^^
<br>
<br>
Here's the in-universe Mission Statement:</p>

	<blockquote class="blockquote">
		<p class="blurb-text text-left px-3 !important"> The “Mobile Iterator Project” (MIP) is a project created and directed by a Benefactor named "No Cost Too Great" (NCTG) with the stated goal of supporting Iterators in their productivity, maintenance, and longevity, so that they can operate at maximum efficiency, even after the inevitable mass ascension. ‘MIP Units—Iterators created under the project—are created puppet-first in the "MIP Development Center" and later assigned to Local Groups, where their structures are built to support the Iterators around them.  
<br>
			<br>
Uniquely, their personalities are heavily based around singular, specific Architects (Benefactors) who donate their memories and qualia. The exception to this is TWR, who features a more traditional personality module. In total, there are 99 MIP Units, with IDs ranging from 01 to 99..</p>
	</blockquote>

<p class="blurb-text text-center mt-3 px-3"> The impetus for this AU was asking "If the Iterators are left behind as Gifts to the World for possible millennia, who shall take care of them?" Of course all Iterators come with various self-repair technologies (like in Downpour!), but there are certain tasks that would be better-fit for a sentient being to help with, such as degradation of communications arrays or delivery. MIP Units are modeled after the Benefactors (Iterator-Builders) specifically to ensure that their presence shall never truly be absent.
<br>
<br>
"What is Rain World?" a cool awesome indie game you should buy and play RIGHT NOW. (link) but if for some reason you've stumbled onto here without already knowing, here's a link to the wiki's entry on <a href="https://rainworld.miraheze.org/wiki/Iterator">Iterators</a>, I guess.

	<!-- TITLE BLURB END -->
	 
	    <div class="lbox2"> 
		    <p class="blurb-text py-2 px-3" style="font-size:90%"> <b>Fanart Boundaries:</b>
		    <br>
		    - Please try to maintain their body types and key aspects of their design. This goes especially for SLS, as she's my sona. I understand that artstyle can play a big role, though.
			    <br>
		    - Palette changes, outfit swaps (nothing suggestive or nsfw), and minor stylistic changes are fine. Again, just try to maintain their general images.
			    <br>
			    - Being asked before drawing my OCs with yours is appreciated 
			    <br>
			    - I also appreciate being tagged if you post the fanart somewhere so i can see it 
		    <br>
			    <br>
		    <b>Characterization Boundaries:</b>
			    <br>
			    - Please do not headcanon them. Don't change my characters' genders, orientations (if stated), major personality traits, etc. They're all very important to me, so changing them hurts.
			    <br>
			    - In a similar vein, please ask me before attempting to include my OCs in your personal lore/worldbuilding.
			    <br>
			   	 <br>
			    <b> NSFW/Suggestive: </b> No. 
			    <br>
			   	 <br>
			    <b> Shipping: </b> I would prefer if you asked first, unless it's something I've established I am comfortable with. (Again, nothing NSFW or overly suggestive, thanks.)
			    <br>
			    	<br>
			    <b> "Simping"/Showing Romantic Interest: </b> This is generally fine with most OCs as long as you're not too aggressive or suggestive about it. Big NO for Frosted Briar (child) and Starlight Symphony (self-insert), though.
				    <br>
			    <br>
			    <b> Using my OCs as Icon/Banner: </b> Fine with credit as long as it is not SLS. 
			    <br>
			    <br>
			    <b> Kinning My OCs: </b> No. A lot of them are based off of parts of my own mind / projections of myself in some way, and it feels weird to have someone claim to be a character you know so intimately. 
			    <br>
			    - Please respect that SLS is a self-insert. Please don't make comments comparing her to yourself. She means a lot to me. Thanks;;
			    <br>
			    <br>
			    <b>Making your Own MIP Unit:</b>  This is currently not available, sorry. Eventually, when I have a more solid grasp on fundamental worldbuilding and important lore, I'll let people do it, but right now it's still too shaky. I only give them to my friends so far.

<h1> Basic Terms:(fix these categories later) </h1>
<br>
<p class="blurb-text px-2" style="font-size:90%"> <b>Architect:</b> Term for a member of the civlization that built the Iterators.
<br>
<br>
<b>Benefactor:</b> Term for the species that Architects belong to. Rose in popularity after the public mass ascension. Favored by more formal individuals.
<br>
<br>
<b>Local Group:</b> A collection of several Iterators, generally within the same "Sector." They have their own hierarchies, and their members tend to work together. The number of Iterators in a LG varies.
<br>
<em>Example: Silent Valley Local Group (Sector S2)</em>
<br>
<b>Group Senior:</b> The eldest member of a Local Group. Takes on administrative and managerial duties in regards to its other members, to varying degrees. Depends on the House(s) behind the members of said Local Group.
<br> 
<em>Example: Everlasting Lotus Waters</em>
<br>
	<br>

<b>Group Supervisor:</b> A member of the Local Group who takes on the responsibilities of the Group Senior despite not being the eldest unit. Generally given in circumstances where a Group Senior is unable to effectively perform their duties or due to outside influence ("Wealthy House Said So").
<br>
-# I'm like 90% sure I subconsciously lifted this from Daszombes's Iterator Logs so Obligatory Plug <--- figure out how to format this to be smaller later.
<br>
<em>Ex: Perpetual Umbra</em>
<br>
	<br>

<b>Administrator:</b> A individual with Administrative Permissions over an Iterator. How much control or influence an Administrator has over their assigned Unit varies (from tech support to complete authority), and some Iterators are given multiple Administrators.
<br>
<em>Ex: NCTG (PU, TWR, SLS, FB)</em>
<br>
	<br>

<b>Creator:</b> An uncommon title for an Individual primarily responsible for the creation of an Iterator Unit. Most Iterator Projects necessitate the cooperation of multiple individuals, so reserving this title for one person is rather egotistical. Since MIP Units are so much smaller in scale, it's... <em>slightly</em> less haughty for NCTG to adopt this title.
	<br>
	<br> <b> The Great Problem: </b> A "problem" that seeks a solution to finding a way to ascend every living being, including the Lesser Beings of the world that lack the natural capacity for enlightenment. Iterators were (at least originally) created to solve it.
	<br>
	<br> <b> The Global Council:</b>
</p> 
	<hr>
	<h1> MIP Terms </h1>
	<p> <b> Director: </b> The Director of the Mobile Iterator Project. They orchestrate and organize its members and goals. "Director" is a title of respect, and MIP Units generally address No Cost Too Great with this honorific. (It's catchier than saying Mx. Cost, so even people unrelated to the Project will often refer to them as "the Director". 
	<br>
		<br> <b> Assistant: </b> title for idc 
		<br>
	<br> <b> Group Assignment: </b> The process by which MIP Units are assigned to support Local Groups. </p>
	<hr>
	<h1> Time Notation / Important Events </h1>
	<p> i dont care rn tbh </p>
	<hr>
	<h1> Iterator Classifications </h1>
	<p> bitches hate to see my classification system. <br>
	<b> Generations/Waves:</b> Generations are overarching categories that vary in length. Generally end on a new Dynasty (good luck.) Each Generation is separated into Waves, and each Wave is a Dynasty (100 revolutions) long. Inspired by Sol prismsoup. (link) Gens and Waves help give a sense of timescale, though there is an air of superiority / inferiority around some of them. <br>
